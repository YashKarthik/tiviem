# tiviem

A rudimentary implementation of EVM in Typescript /ti:vi:Îµm/. Built during [Nigts & Weekends S3](https://buildspace.so/).


I'm still figuring this out, help is appreciated!

## Development
Clone repo and install dependencies using:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run main.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.5.9. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
