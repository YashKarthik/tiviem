A rudimentary implementation of EVM in Typescript /ti:vi:Îµm/.

I'm still figuring this out, help is appreciated!

## Plan
I've read a decent amount about how EVM works under the hood. I understand stack-based-machines and the different data locations. Quick primer: [learnevm.com](learnevm.com/)

Here's my plan for building this:
- [X] Write a basic bytecode parser/de-compiler for the basic opcodes. It will take in the supplied bytecode(and any args) and print out the operations it would perform on it.
- [X] Now that my program understands bytecode and what the different opcodes are supposed to do, I'll get on with implementing the operations for each opcode. While I do this, I'll also have to setup the different data locations and let the program interact with memory / storage based on the opcode.
  - [X] Implemented basic opcodes (add, mul, sub, div) (need to confirm they emulate evm's math errors)
  - [X] implemented a basic stack.
  - [X] Read up on signed vs unsigned operations. I thikn I understand this, but still.
  - [X] Implement memory
  - [X] Implement storage
- [X] After this I guess I'll work on the gas mechanism that will prevent infinite loops and network spam.
- [ ] Work on returning state to initial value when REVERT-ed.
- [ ] clean up
- [ ] Ensure gas and ether transfers actually work
- [ ] more tests

## Development
Clone repo and install dependencies using:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.5.9. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
